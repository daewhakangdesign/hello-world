# hello-world

Hello DaeWha Kang Design!
This is our readme edits branch edit of our hello world github project. 
Now we know how to create a pull request and merge the pull.
This is not completely integrated.

What is the rest here? If I make this change, can I make it commit?

#I want to put a lot of new changes here.
#I might use one of my python coders to do things and to play around.
#I can make a lot of different changes. Ultimately what I hope to do is commit this change,
#Then make a pull request to put this back into the main branch, and finally accept
#The pull and merge to the master branch.
